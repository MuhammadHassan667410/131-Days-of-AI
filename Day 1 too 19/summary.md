#  Day 01 to Day 19 - AI Learning Summary

This file contains a summary of everything Iâ€™ve learned in the first 19 days of my 131-day AI journey. I'm focusing on building a strong foundation in Python and core AI concepts.

---

##  Python Basics (Day 1â€“5)
- Variables, data types, strings
- If/else, loops, and functions
- Input/output and basic error handling

##  Data Structures (Day 6â€“8)
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Nested structures and iteration
- Practice problems using real-world logic

##  File Handling & CSV (Day 9â€“10)
- Reading and writing `.txt` and `.csv` files
- Using `with open()`, `readlines()`, `pandas.read_csv()`

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (Day 11â€“13)
- Pandas DataFrames
- Data cleaning, filtering, sorting
- Descriptive stats and visualization with `matplotlib` & `seaborn`

##  Numpy & Arrays (Day 14â€“15)
- Creating, reshaping, slicing arrays
- Broadcasting and performance over loops

##  Pandas Deep Dive (Day 16â€“17)
- GroupBy, merging, joining
- Handling missing data, data types

##  ML Introduction (Day 18â€“19)
- What is Machine Learning?
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- Overview of scikit-learn and real-life use cases

---

##  Key Skills Acquired
- Python fundamentals for data science
- Working with CSV and real datasets
- Core libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- Started understanding machine learning theory

##  What's Next?
From Day 20 onward, Iâ€™ll dive deeper into:
- Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, KNN, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics
- Hands-on model training and prediction

Stay tuned! ðŸš€
