# 🧠 Day 29 to 33 – Unsupervised Learning Summary

This section of my 131-day AI learning plan focuses on **Unsupervised Learning**, where the model discovers hidden patterns or structures in **unlabeled data** without explicit supervision.

## 📘 Daily Breakdown

### 🔍 Day 29: Clustering vs Classification
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Applications: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, compression
- Introduction to clustering algorithms

### 🎯 Day 30: K-Means Clustering
- Grouped data into K clusters based on similarity
- Concepts: Centroids, Inertia, Elbow Method
- Implemented using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`
- Visualized clusters on real-world data

### 🌀 Day 31: Hierarchical Clustering
- Created a dendrogram for hierarchical grouping
- Explored agglomerative vs divisive approaches
- Used `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for plotting
- Applied on synthetic and real datasets

### 🌐 Day 32: DBSCAN
- Density-based clustering that handles noise
- Automatically detects number of clusters
- Better suited for arbitrary shapes and outliers
- Compared with K-Means on noisy data

### 📉 Day 33: PCA – Dimensionality Reduction
- Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature space
- Preserved maximum variance while reducing dimensions
- Visualized high-dimensional data in 2D
- Combined with clustering for enhanced insight
